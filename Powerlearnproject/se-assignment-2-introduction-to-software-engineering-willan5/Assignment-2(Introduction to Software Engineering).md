**1. Define Software Engineering:**

Is the science of developing software applications tailored to provide a specific solution. It often involves an individual developer or a group of developers working on a pre defined  set of rules and principles known within the displine to ensure quality production within a specific set of time.


**2. What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?**

Software engineering observe engineering principles to ensure the quality of the end product while tradition programming is more of inclined to solve a particular and not necessarily observing the principals of maintanability and reusability.


**3. Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. Agile vs. Waterfall Models:**

**Software Development Life Cycle**

**i.    Requirement gathering:**
     Developers collaborate to crate documentation of the software while considering the user needs and technical specifications.


**ii.   Design:**
    This involves the planning and structuring of the software in question. It involves the design of the UI and databases or any other area that may impact the use of the software.

**iii.  Implemenation:**
    Here is where the actual coding is done following the agreed plan in the previous phases.

**1v.   Testing:**
    At this point, the developers test the functionality of the software to see if it serve its purpose.

**v.    Deployment:**
    Once testing has been done and the team has been satisfied on its functionalities, deployment is then done to give access to users.

**vi.    Maintenance:**
    This involves support to help users by keeping the software updated to ensure proper functionality.

**4. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Requirements Engineering:**

**Waterfall**

    Its a traditional approach to software development that follows each step of SDLC to completion before moving to the next.

    Its suitable for projects where the functionalities of the end product acan be predicted before hand.

**Agile**

    Is a way ofdevelopment that is repeatatve.
    Through the development process, it enssure collaboration and eedback from the users as the product is being developed.
