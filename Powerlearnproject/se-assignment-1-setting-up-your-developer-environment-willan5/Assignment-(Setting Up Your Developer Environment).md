# Setup Development Environment

**Choice of operating system**

 My choice of the OS to be used is windows 11 running on a core i 5 intel processor machine.

 This is what i am comfortable with for now although i will explore other operating systems later.
 ##

**Text Editor**

 I have a VScode version 1.90.0
 On it, i have my plugins for development, name:

    Project manager  -  For management of my projects.

    Git - for version control

    Github - To help ease interactions with github

    Pylance - To help with python development

    Markdownlint - To help in writing and documentation.
##
**Set Up Version Control System:**

I have set up a git account with a repository called 'my_powerlearnrepo' for the projects that i will be doing in this training.

The link to the repository is, https://github.com/willan5/my_powerlearnrepo.
The repository is private but if there will be a requirement to have a public repository, i will be open to it.

**Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:**

My language of choice is python, which is the language of my interest, i have a 3.12 installed.

**Mysql**

I finally managed to install mysql, i had to do a custom installation because i had issues installing the various versions available.

I have Mysql version 8.0.37
